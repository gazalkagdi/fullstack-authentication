# Project Title

Login and Signup System with Vite + React Frontend and Node.js + MySQL Backend

# Description:

This project is a complete authentication system featuring both frontend and backend components. The frontend is built using Vite and React, providing a modern and efficient user interface for user login and registration. On the backend, Node.js and MySQL are utilized to handle user authentication, storing user credentials securely in a database.

Additionally, the project includes a folder containing SQL queries for setting up the required database schema and tables. These queries can be used to initialize the MySQL database and configure it for use with the backend.

# Features:

1) User Registration: Users can sign up for a new account by providing a valid email address and a password. Passwords are securely hashed before being stored in the database.

2) User Login: Registered users can securely log in using their email address and password combination.

3) Password Encryption: Passwords are encrypted using bcrypt before being stored in the database, ensuring maximum security for user credentials.

4) Input Validation: Input fields are validated both on the frontend and backend to ensure data integrity and prevent common security vulnerabilities.

5) Responsive Design: The frontend user interface is designed to be responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience across a wide range of devices and screen sizes.

# Technologies Used:

Frontend: Vite, React, Axios, Tailwind CSS

Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, bcrypt
